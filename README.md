# Item List Manager - React Assessment

## Project Overview

This project is my solution to the **Item List Manager** assessment for a React position. The objective was to create a simple React app that allows users to manage a list of items, where users can add items, and the list will dynamically update.

### Key Features:
- **Add items**: Users can type the name of an item and add it to the list.
- **Dynamic Updates**: The list automatically updates as new items are added.
- **Input Validation**: Items are only added when the input field is not empty.
- **Simple and Intuitive UI**: The app is designed to be user-friendly and responsive.

### Demo Link

You can view the live demo of this application here:  
[Item List Manager - GitHub Pages]([https://<your-username>.github.io/Item-List-Manager](https://StephanBegins.github.io/Item-List-Manager))

### GitHub Repository

You can explore the full source code for this project here:  
[Item List Manager - GitHub Repository]([https://github.com/<your-username>/Item-List-Manager](https://StephanBegins.github.io/Item-List-Manager))

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Item-List-Manager.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Item-List-Manager
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Run the app locally:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run deploy`

Deploys the app to GitHub Pages.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive mode.  
See [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

Ejects the configuration for full control over it (e.g., webpack, Babel, ESLint).  
This action is irreversible.

## Notes for Reviewers

- The app allows users to input an item name, which is added to the list when the "Add Item" button is clicked.
- If the input field is empty and the button is clicked, nothing is added to the list.
- This solution demonstrates basic React concepts, including state management and event handling.

This version of your README includes a more structured explanation of your solution, links to both the live demo and the GitHub repository, installation instructions, and a section for the reviewer. This should help clarify your approach and provide everything needed for the reviewer to understand your solution and access it.
